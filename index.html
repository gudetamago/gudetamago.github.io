                    <p>For She Codes Plus 2025, the personal project requirement was to do a crowdfunding website, where
                        people can create campaigns and pledge their support for a chosen campaign. We were free to choose
                        a theme for the crowdfunding website, and my chosen theme was a crowdfunding website for supervillains,
                        as starting and maintaining a villain's lair is a costly affair.</p>
                    <p>Notable feature of the project was that the website looked like a crowdfunding website for charity
                        knitting projects for animals in need, until you're logged in and the displayed content changed accordingly
                        to show the 'real' website.</p>
                    <h3 class="flex justify-left padding-small"><a href="./group_project.html">Group Project</a></h3>
                    <p>Group Project for Full-stack Frogs (that's the team name) was to create a mood/workload tracker to
                        allow a manager to monitor their team's wellbeing. A team member was to log their mood and workload
                        every week, whilst a manager can view a dashboard containing aggregated data logged by their team
                        members.</p>
                    <p>Notable challenge was in ensuring that a team member can only log their data once a week, defining
                        what a 'week' meant, and in displaying the data segregated by team as a manager can manage multiple
                        teams.</p>
