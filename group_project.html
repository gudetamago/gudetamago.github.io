                    <p>Group Project for Full-stack Frogs (that's the team name) was to create a mood/workload tracker to
                        allow a manager to monitor their team's wellbeing. A team member was to log their mood and workload
                        every week, whilst a manager can view a dashboard containing aggregated data logged by their team
                        members.</p><br>
                    <p>Kudos to the frontend team for making this really pretty.</p><br>

                    <p>When a normal user logged in, they're shown the 'Pulse' check in form. But when a manager logged in, 
                        they're shown a dashboard containing data visualisations of their team's logged data. This required
                        setting up different user roles and permissions in the backend, and then ensuring that the frontend
                        displayed the correct information based on the user's role. Below are screenshots, for user and
                        manager respectively.</p><br>

            <h2 class="flex justify-right padding-small">Challenges</h2>
            <div class="flex row justify-center">
                <div class="flex column justify-center align-left padding-small">
                    <p>I can only write about challenges faced by the backend, as I chose to not contribute to the frontend.</p><br>
                    <h3>Weekly Limitations</h3><br>
                    <p>Notable challenge was in ensuring that a team member can only log their data once a week, defining
                        what a 'week' meant, and in displaying the data segregated by team as a manager can manage multiple
                        teams. Discussions we had around this topic was centred around timezones, and what would
                     be defined as a "week". 2 people on opposite ends of the globe could be logging their Pulse at the same
                     time, and yet for one of them it's Sunday night and for the other it's Monday morning. Should the data be
                     logged against separate weeks?</p><br>
                     <p>Adding to the complexity was that whilst Python (the backend) had built in library to determine what the
                        current week index was, JavaScript (the frontend) did not. This meant that we would had to implement this
                        in the front end, and frankly it was beginning to get very complicated. In the end, we decided to let the
                        frontend simply send the current date and time to the backend, and let the backend determine if the user had already
                        logged their Pulse for the current week.
                     </p><br>
                     <p>The design for the database changed as well to accomodate this weekly check. Originally we were only going
                        to store the timestamp and calculate the week index on the fly, but this would had meant more calculations
                        and checks every time a user tried to log their Pulse. Instead, we decided to store the week index along with
                        the timestamp, so that checking if a user had already logged their Pulse for the week would be a simple database query. 
                        This also made it easier to manipulate data for demo purposes, to generate more data than what was realitically possible 
                        within the time frame of the project.
                     </p><br>

                     <h3>Limiting The Number of Pulse Logs</h3><br>
                     <p>Another challenge was in determining how much data to return to the front end. If we used an example of 20 active users
                        each logging their Pulse every week, over a year that's over 1000 entries. If a manager had multiple teams, this number could
                        easily double or triple. Returning all this data to the front end every time a manager wanted to view their dashboard would be 
                        inefficient and slow.
                     </p><br>
                     <p>To solve this, the POST method was written to accept optional parameter of weeks_total, which would limit the number of 
                        weeks of data returned. So if a manager only wanted to see the last 4 weeks of data, they could specify weeks_total=4 
                        in their request, and the backend would only return the relevant data. The method was also written to ignore any week
                        for which there was no data lodged. This significantly reduced the amount of data being sent over the network, improving 
                        performance and user experience.
                        </p><br>

                    <h3>Incentives/Gamification</h3><br>
                    <p>To encourage users to log their Pulse regularly, an incentives system was implemented. Users would earn points
                        for each Pulse logged, with bonus points for consecutive weeks of logging. As this feature was implemented fairly late, it
                         was too complicated to implement this logic in the backend and doing back calculations for data that had already been logged. 
                         We agreed to implement this logic in the frontend instead, relying on the front end to do the calculation and telling the
                         backend what points to update the user record to.
                     </p><br>
                     <p>This was not ideal as it opened up the possibility of users manipulating their points by sending false data to the backend.
                        However, given the time constraints and the complexity of implementing this logic in the backend, we ignored this risk. 
                        Future iterations of the project could look into implementing this logic in the backend to ensure data integrity.
                     </p><br>
                     <p>One notable feature was the POST method. We overloaded the POST method to create a new user_points record if none existed 
                        for a given user_id. Otherwise, it would update the existing record with the new points value. This was done with the aim of
                    making sure that there was ever only 1 record for each user_id.</p>
